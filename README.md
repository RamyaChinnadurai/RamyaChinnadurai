*I am a maverick, who thinks outside the box, refuse to play by the rules, take risks and have a relentless drive to reinvent and revolutionise the system.*

My coding journey started from C, Java, PHP and now working on nextjs. Crossed working with languages, tools and platforms like react, node, MongoDB, AWS, firebase, and lot more.

I’m a curious learner and you can see me with my laptop except for my sleeping hours. I have tried out with several things like stories, poets and drawings. If you wish to see my doodlings check out my [blog](https://rams.codes). 

I’ll share topics related to Javascript, Nodejs, APIs and concepts like UI/UX, product design, development with my learning and experience here and twitter.

Follow me in twitter [@code_rams](https://twitter.com/code_rams) to get connected. 
Trust me you wont feel bored :p
