# Hi there <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px">, I am Rams!                                           ![twitter-follower](https://img.shields.io/twitter/follow/code_rams?style=social)


A passionate full-stack web developer with experience in building the product from scratch. Had an in-depth knowledge in building the startup environment and being a core member in two startups. Currently creating and building products that kindle my interest and passion.


*I am a maverick, who thinks outside the box, refuse to play by the rules, take risks and have a relentless drive to reinvent and revolutionise the system.*

My coding journey started from C, Java, PHP and now working on nextjs. Crossed working with languages, tools and platforms like react, node, MongoDB, AWS, firebase, and lot more.

I’m a curious learner and you can see me with my laptop except for my sleeping hours. I have tried out with several things like stories, poets and drawings. If you wish to see my doodlings check out my [blog](https://rams.codes). 

I’ll share topics related to Javascript, Nodejs, APIs and concepts like UI/UX, product design, development with my learning and experience here and twitter.
